# ðŸ©º Electronic Stethoscope

This is my graduation project from MET Academy, focused on building a low-cost, smart **Electronic Stethoscope**. The system combines a traditional stethoscope with digital components to monitor heart and lung sounds and evaluate ECG signals.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Captures chest sounds using a stethoscope chest piece and microphone  
- Records and amplifies sounds using a connected application  
- Uses an ECG sensor to collect heart signal data  
- Sends ECG signals to the app for basic evaluation (normal or abnormal)

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. **Chest Piece + Mic** â†’ Captures and sends audio to the app  
2. **ECG Sensor** â†’ Captures heart signals  
3. **Application** â†’  
   - Records and amplifies heart/lung sounds  
   - Displays and analyzes ECG signals
